<h1>
Small Improvements <br>
  
</h1>
  
<p1>
  "When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur...Don't look for the quick improvement. 
Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That's the only way it happens - and when it happens, it lasts." - John Wooden <br>
Rome wasn't built in a day. In order to become skilled at something, you need to get the small steps done before you finish the
  staircase.

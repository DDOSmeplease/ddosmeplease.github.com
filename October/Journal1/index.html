<h1>Logo Reflection</h1>
<p1>
  <style>
     
    h1 {font-size: 64; background: linear-gradient(grey, white); text-align: center; border: 1px solid black;}
    p1 {font-size: 44;}
    
  </style>
I think my logo didn't turn out so well. It looked kinda sloppy and just didn't turn out the way I had hoped it would.
